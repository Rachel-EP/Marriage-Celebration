        <p>
            These are the places to stay nearby us in Oakville. Our recommendation is the Holiday Inn Oakville (Centre) since this is where the limo bus will be picking everyone up for the celebration and its convenient spot next to the Oakville train station. We have also listed two other options; the Monte Carlo Inn is very close by to the Holiday Inn and is therefore a great spot as well; and of course Oakville is also home to many AirBnBs though it may be difficult to find one with a price that rivals either suggested hotel.

        <h2 id="AirBnB">
            AirBnB
        </h2>
        <p>
            Airbnbs in Oakville offer a unique and personalized lodging experience for guests looking for a home-like environment. These accommodations range from cozy apartments in the heart of downtown to spacious homes in quiet, residential neighborhoods, providing a variety of options to suit different group sizes and preferences.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Pros of Choosing an AirBnB:</b>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Space and Privacy: Many Airbnbs offer more space than traditional hotel rooms, making them ideal for families or groups of friends traveling together. Guests can enjoy separate bedrooms, living areas, and even full kitchens, allowing for a more relaxed and homely stay.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Local Experience: Staying in an Airbnb can provide a more authentic experience of Oakville, with the opportunity to live like a local in charming neighborhoods. Some properties may also include outdoor spaces like gardens or patios, perfect for gathering with fellow guests.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Cost-Effective for Groups: For larger groups, Airbnbs can often be more economical than booking multiple hotel rooms, especially when considering the added amenities like kitchens and living spaces.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Cons to Consider:</b>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Location and Transportation: Unlike hotels, which are often centrally located, some Airbnbs may be farther from key areas such as the Oakville GO Station and the Holiday Inn where the limo bus will pick guests up. This can make transportation more challenging and potentially more costly, especially if ride-sharing services or taxis are needed frequently.
                </li>
                <li>
                     Limited Services: Unlike hotels, Airbnbs typically do not offer daily housekeeping, on-site restaurants, or concierge services. Guests will need to manage these aspects themselves, which might be less convenient for those looking for a more traditional, service-oriented experience.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Variability in Quality: While many Airbnbs are well-maintained, the quality can vary widely depending on the host. It's important to read reviews and check ratings to ensure a comfortable and pleasant stay.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
            Overall, choosing an Airbnb in Oakville can provide a unique and cost-effective alternative to traditional hotels, particularly for those seeking more space and a local touch. However, it’s important to consider the potential trade-offs, especially in terms of location and the availability of services, to ensure a smooth and enjoyable experience for your wedding celebration.
