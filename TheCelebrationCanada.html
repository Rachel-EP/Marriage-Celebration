            The Dress Code
        </h2>
        <p>
            We have opted for a cocktail dress code for our celebration. For those travelling from around the province we understand it is difficult to travel with large suit jackets or full floor-length gowns, cocktail attire should help ease that burden. There is no level of colour coordination, feel free to wear whatever colour or pattern you think is fun or looks the best on you! 
        </p>
        <p>
            For more information on cocktail dress code please visit this site: <a href="https://www.reviewed.com/style/features/cocktail-wedding-attire" target="_blank"> link</a>. There are many different guides and photo ideas out there and many formal attire shops will sort based on dress code.

            The Menu
        </h2>
        <p>
            Rachel and Steven taste tested the many options the Cambridge Mill has to offer, and has picked the best of the best for the menu of the night.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Appetizer</b>: an heirloom tomato soup with fresh baked sourdough crutons and herb infused cream. (For those with dietary restrictions, a Farm Greens salad will be available with spring vegetables, pickled shallots, and crumbled feta cheese)
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Main Course</b>: for the entree, you get to pick from three options.
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Braised Short Ribs with jus (gluten free)
            </li>
            <li>
                Steelhead Trout with a lemona nd garlic herb butter(gluten free)
            </li>
            <li>
                Blistered Heirloom Tomato and Caramelized Onion Tart with crumbled goat cheese and a basil pesto
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
            All of the above options come served with housemade mashed potatoes (which are to die for), and side fresh greenery.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Dessert</b>: Rachel and Steven chose a Mascapone cheesecake with strawberry compote as their main dessert.
