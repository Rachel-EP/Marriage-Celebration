            The Dress Code
        </h2>
        <p>
            We have opted for a cocktail dress code for our celebration. For those travelling from around the province we understand it is difficult to travel with large suit jackets or full floor-length gowns, cocktail attire should help ease that burden. There is no level of colour coordination, feel free to wear whatever colour or pattern you think is fun or looks the best on you! 
        </p>
        <p>
            For more information on cocktail dress code please visit this site: <a href="https://www.reviewed.com/style/features/cocktail-wedding-attire" target="_blank"> link</a>. There are many different guides and photo ideas out there and many formal attire shops will sort based on dress code.
