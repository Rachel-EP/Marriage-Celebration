            The Dress Code
        </h2>
        <p>
            For our dress code we have opted for Cocktail attire. For those travelling from Florida we understand it is difficult to travel with large suit jackets or full floor-length gowns, cocktail attire should help ease that burden. For women this means a tea-length, knee-length, or midi dress (though a dressy pantsuit is also an option). For men, most sources will say to bring a suit jacket however, for those travelling please feel free to ignore that suggestion. There is no level of colour coordination, feel free to wear whatever colour or pattern you think is fun or looks the best on you! 
        </p>
        <p>
            For more information on cocktail dress code please visit this site: <a href="https://www.reviewed.com/style/features/cocktail-wedding-attire" target="_blank"> link</a>. There are many different guides and photo ideas out there and many formal attire shops will sort based on dress code.
