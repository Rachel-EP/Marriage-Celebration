            Tuesday July 1st (Canada Day)
        </h2>
        <p>
            If you would like to spend the whole week in Canada this would certainly be the week to do it, Canada Day is a joy to spend in the country and a great way to kick off the week of celebrations and day trips.
        </p>
        <p>
            July 1st is Canada Day which marks the anniversary of the confederation in 1867 when the three separate colonies of the Province of Canada, New Brunswick, and Nova Scotia united to form the country of Canada. It’s a day filled with festivities, where you’ll find everything from parades to concerts, and fireworks lighting up the night sky.
        </p>
        <p>
            In major cities like Toronto, Ottawa, and Vancouver, the celebrations are grand and vibrant. Toronto's celebrations typically include a parade through the downtown core, concerts at Nathan Phillips Square, and a spectacular fireworks show over Lake Ontario. Ottawa, the nation's capital, is the heart of the festivities, with Parliament Hill hosting live performances and ceremonies, culminating in a breathtaking fireworks display that illuminates the Ottawa River.
        </p>
        <p>
            Even if staying in a smaller town like Oakville you're sure to find festivities and closed off main streets for pedestrian friendly events like parades, live music and beautiful art.
