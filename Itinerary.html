        <p>
            If you would like to spend the whole week in Canada this would certainly be the week to do it, Canada Day is a joy to spend in the country and a great way to kick off the week of celebrations and day trips.

            July 1st is Canada Day which marks the anniversary of the Confederation in 1867 when the three separate colonies of the Province of Canada, New Brunswick, and Nova Scotia united to form the country of Canada. It’s a day filled with festivities, where you’ll find everything from parades to concerts, and fireworks lighting up the night sky.
