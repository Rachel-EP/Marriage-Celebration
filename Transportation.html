            Most transportation will be done through public transit (except for day of the celebration, which will be done by private limo bus). Please note that Ontario public transit is entirely different than Florida public transit. Public transit in Ontario is reliable, comfortable, and usable to get to most places.
        </p>
        <p>
            Below you will find all forms of transit you might need throughout your trip, please note that there is a difference between GO Transit (buses and trains) and City transit (Oakville transit, Toronto transit and Niagara transit). GO Transit is for inter-city travel, when travelling between cities we will use GO Transit. City transit is for transportation within that city; Oakville transit will only cover travelling within Oakville.

            Service Details
        </h3>
        <p>
            <b>Oakville to Toronto:</b> The Oakville GO Station is a major stop along the Lakeshore West line, which runs directly to Union Station in downtown Toronto. The journey typically takes around 30 minutes, making it a fast option for reaching the city. Trains run frequently throughout the day, particularly during peak commuting hours, and there is a late-night service for those returning after an evening in Toronto.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Union Station:</b> Union Station is Toronto’s central hub for GO Transit, connecting to multiple other GO lines, as well as the TTC subway, streetcars, and buses. From Union, travelers can easily access key Toronto attractions such as the CN Tower, Ripley's Aquarium, and the Toronto Islands.
        </p>
        <h3>
            Payment Methods (All Prices will be in CAD)
        </h3>
        <p>
            GO Transit offers a variety of payment options to ensure flexibility and convenience:
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <b>E-Tickets:</b> For those preferring digital options, GO Transit offers e-tickets that can be purchased online and stored on your phone. These e-tickets are valid for one-way or two-way return trips and must be activated before boarding the train. Special weekend passes for unlimited travel on Saturdays, Sundays, or holidays are also available for a flat rate of $10 per day. 
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>PRESTO Card:</b> The most common payment method by Canadians is the PRESTO card, which allows riders to tap on and off at the beginning and end of their journey. PRESTO cards can be loaded with funds online, through the app, or at stations. It also offers discounts for seniors, students, and frequent travelers. PRESTO Cards cost $5 each (plus the amount loaded on to the card) and can be bought at many retail stores as well as at stations and the airport. PRESTO users have a slightly reduced fare but it will take a few trips to even out the $5 initial cost.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Credit or Debit Card:</b> As of 2023, GO Transit has introduced contactless payments using credit or debit cards. You can tap your Visa, Mastercard, or American Express directly on a PRESTO reader, or use your mobile wallet via Apple Pay or Google Pay. Make sure you tap off with the same card or device you used to tap on to avoid being overcharged. NOTE: if using a US bank card there will most often be transaction fees.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Physical Tickets:</b> Physical GO Train tickets can be purchased from the GO Station in person.
