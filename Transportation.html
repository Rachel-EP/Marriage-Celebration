            GO Trains provide a convenient and efficient way to travel across the Greater Toronto Area (GTA), including key connections between Oakville and Toronto. These trains are part of the regional public transit system operated by Metrolinx and are well-known for their reliability and comfort, making them a popular choice for both commuters and tourists.

            Service Details
        </h3>
        <p>
            <b>Oakville to Toronto:</b> The Oakville GO Station is a major stop along the Lakeshore West line, which runs directly to Union Station in downtown Toronto. The journey typically takes around 30 minutes, making it a fast option for reaching the city. Trains run frequently throughout the day, particularly during peak commuting hours, and there is a late-night service for those returning after an evening in Toronto.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Union Station:</b> Union Station is Toronto’s central hub for GO Transit, connecting to multiple other GO lines, as well as the TTC subway, streetcars, and buses. From Union, travelers can easily access key Toronto attractions such as the CN Tower, Ripley's Aquarium, and the Toronto Islands.
        </p>
        <h3>
            Payment Methods (All Prices will be in CAD)
        </h3>
        <p>
            GO Transit offers a variety of payment options to ensure flexibility and convenience:
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <b>PRESTO Card:</b> The most common payment method is the PRESTO card, which allows riders to tap on and off at the beginning and end of their journey. PRESTO cards can be loaded with funds online, through the app, or at stations. It also offers discounts for seniors, students, and frequent travelers. PRESTO Cards cost $5 each (plus the amount loaded on to the card) and can be bought at many retail stores in Oakville or Toronto. This is worth it the more often you travel using it as the PRESTO fare is reduced though not by much.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Credit or Debit Card:</b> As of 2023, GO Transit has introduced contactless payments using credit or debit cards. You can tap your Visa, Mastercard, American Express, or Interac debit card directly on a PRESTO reader, or use your mobile wallet via Apple Pay or Google Pay. This method is particularly useful for occasional riders or tourists who may not have a PRESTO card. Ensure you tap off with the same card or device you used to tap on to avoid being overcharged. NOTE: if using an American bank card there may be transaction fees.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>E-Tickets:</b> For those preferring digital options, GO Transit offers e-tickets that can be purchased online and stored on your smartphone. These e-tickets are valid for one-way or return trips and must be activated before boarding the train. Special weekend passes for unlimited travel on Saturdays, Sundays, or holidays are also available for a flat rate of $10.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Physical Tickets:</b> Physical GO Train tickets can be purchased from the GO Station in person.
