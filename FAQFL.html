        <p>
            We are not expecting gifts from our Florida guests. We understand that travelling for our celebration is going to be expensive. We are very happy to be able to spend a wonderful long weekend with everyone and consider that a gift.

            We fully encourage everyone to take lots of photos during the celebration. We are not hiring a photographer and will have a photo sharing site available for everyone to use afterwards.

            If you have a public social media profile we ask that you refrain from posting any photos that have any identifying features. If you have a private social media feel free to post any photos of the event that you wish!

                What is the dress code?
            </b>
        </p>
        <p>
            Our dress code is cocktail attire. We ask you to be creative, no colour is off limits and no pattern is off limits. If you are worried about what to wear it's going to be best to lean toward dressy cocktail attire, it's better to be overdressed than underdressed.

                Should I wear any specific colour or fabric?
            </b>
        </p>
        <p>
            No colour is off limits, even white. As for fabrics, lean towards dressier fabrics and away from anything that may feel too casual like a summer beach dress etc.
