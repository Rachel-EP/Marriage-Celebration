        </p>
        <p>
            We have chosen to create our registry on a third party platform that will link to all the place we have registered. If you make a purchase of one of the items on the registry without going through the third party site please make sure you check it off on the registry so everyone knows it's been purchased.

        </p>
        <p>
            Instead of having gifts sent to the venue we ask that you please send any gifts to our home at 252 Littlewood Dr.

        </p>
        <p>
            The registry has items we need/want/like the design of, however, we would be open to additions if you happen to think of something else we might need or want. We also have a cash fund set up which will go towards our house downpayment.

            We fully encourage everyone to take lots of photos during the celebration. We are not hiring a photographer and will have a photo sharing site available for everyone to use afterwards.

        <p>
            If you have a public social media profile we ask that you refrain from posting any photos that have any identifying features. If you have a private social media feel free to post any photos of the event that you wish!

                What is the dress code?
            </b>
        </p>
        <p>
            Our dress code is cocktail attire. Cocktail attire challenges you to be creative, no colour is off limits and no pattern is off limits. If you are worried about what to wear it's going to be best to lean toward dressy cocktail attire, it's better to be overdressed than underdressed.

            <b>
                Should I wear any specific colour or fabric?
            </b>
        </p>
        <p>
            No colour is off limits, even white. As for fabrics, lean towards dressier fabrics and away from anything that may feel too casual like a summer beach dress etc.
