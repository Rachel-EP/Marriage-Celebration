                Crawford Lake: an exceptional park with a beautiful lake. In the deepest part of the lake 75ft below the surface, sediment is deposited in annual layers and remains totally undisturbed. Scientists researching this sediment in the early 1970s discovered corn pollen dating from the 13th to 15th century. This led to the discovery of the archaeological footprints of a Wendat or Attawandaron village. Three longhouses from this village have been reconstructed on their original footprint to help educate the public about the areaâ€™s Indigenous history through programs, exhibits, gardens, and workshops developed with Indigenous partners of the park. Here you can walk the Meromictic lake boardwalk (with chances to see turtles) and explore the reconstructed Iroquois village complete with longhouses.
