        <h1>Inclement Weather Day Plan</h1>
        <p id="intro-paragraph1">
            In the event of inclement weather that would affect the Niagara Falls trip or possibly the downtown Oakville trip we would instead go to Square One Shopping Centre for the day. (With the exception of transportation, prices will vary based on activity and chosen restaurants).

        <h3>The Food District $$</h3>
            <p>
                <img src="images/FoodDistrict.jpg" alt="" height="175" id="food-district-photo">
                The Food District at Square One in Mississauga is the perfect spot for anyone who loves to try a variety of foods in one  place. With its market-style setup, you can easily explore different specialty shops, each offering their own unique flavors and treats. From freshly baked pastries to gourmet chocolates, artisan cheeses, and international dishes, there’s something new to discover at every corner. Whether you’re in the mood for a little bit of everything or want to sample something new, The Food District makes it easy to taste your way through a wide range of delicious options all under one roof. One thing Rachel says is a must try is Sweet Jesus Ice Cream, it is only available in Canada and it is the best ice cream you will ever have! To read more on the Food District Website click

        <h3>The Food Court $</h3>
        <p>
            In addition to the Food District there is also a more traditional food court with many options including New York Fries which is where Rachel gets her favourite poutine if you want to give it a try (The poutine is also vegetarian, using a mushroom gravy)! The food court in Square One is large and includes all types of food you can think of.

        <h3>Surrounding Sit Down Restaurants $$$</h3>
        <p>
            One of the charms of the Square One Mall is it's location in the middle of the city centre surrounded by well known sit down resrtaurants. These restaurants tend to be much more high end (and therefore higher priced) than those within the mall and the food court but many are defintiely worth it. One of these restaurants that Rachel and Steven love for a date night is called Jack Astors (yes that's the real name), which offers great food for a higher but still decent price as well as having a fun atmosphere. Another option nearby is called The Keg, this is a steakhouse chain in Canada, it is very expensive but defnitiely worth the try if you love steak and/or seafood. To look at restaurants nearby the mall, click <a href="https://www.google.ca/maps/place/Square+One+Shopping+Centre/@43.5936112,-79.6420928,15.82z/data=!3m1!5s0x882b472ec9255185:0x4eafad18fb993530!4m6!3m5!1s0x882b47149e001f97:0xf50b13c4cabe7fbc!8m2!3d43.5930011!4d-79.6424732!16zL20vMDU5N3hi?entry=ttu" target="_blank"> here</a>.

        <p>
            Most of the stores in Square One are going to be ones you have in the USA as well with a few exceptions: Roots and Simons mainly. Roots is a leather company mostly, they make purses, wallets etc. However their iconic clothing is also well known to Canadians as super comfortable and instantly recognizable; they have sweaters, sweatpants, and other workout attire. Simons is a brand that started in Montreal Quebec and is a department store for clothing and home items. While their products are very pretty and well made it can also be expensive. While looking through the directory or wandering through the mall you are also likely to find many sotres you've not seen before so feel free to check them all out!

            The REC Room would be where we may spend most of our time during this day trip to Square One as it had so many acitvities including:

            General transport will be through a bus that runs directly from the Oakville GO Station to Square One bus terminal (GO bus 56). <a href="https://www.google.ca/maps/dir/Holiday+Inn+Oakville+(Centre),+an+IHG+Hotel,+Argus+Road,+Oakville,+ON/Square+One+Shopping+Centre,+100+City+Centre+Dr,+Mississauga,+ON+L5B+2C9/@43.5281186,-79.8247156,11z/am=t/data=!3m2!4b1!5s0x882b472ec9255185:0x4eafad18fb993530!4m14!4m13!1m5!1m1!1s0x882b5ce7f77d1613:0xd62db4e32ba8c4dd!2m2!1d-79.6856205!2d43.4581126!1m5!1m1!1s0x882b47149e001f97:0xf50b13c4cabe7fbc!2m2!1d-79.6424732!2d43.5930011!3e3?entry=ttu" target="_blank">This</a> is the information on Google Maps.
